Comment[Submitted Name]	Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of mRNA from lungs of WT and Pglyrp1-/- mice sensitized with HDM
Experiment Description	Wild type (WT) and Pglyrp1-/- mice were treated with PBS or sensitized 5 days/week for 3 or 5 weeks with 10 M-BM-5l per application of 2.5 mg/ml of purified house dust mite allergen. 3 days after the last sensitization the lungs were removed and homogenized, and RNA was isolated from the right lobes using the TRIZOL method. Quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify the amounts of mRNA in the lungs using custom RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays designed by us and manufactured by Qiagen/SA Biosciences. qRT-PCR gene expression profiling

Protocol Description	For each gene, M-NM-^TCt was calculated using the same threshold (0.2) for all genes and Ct>35 considered as no expression, followed by normalization to 5 housekeeping genes (Hsp90ab1, Gusb, Hprt1, Gapdh, and Actb) included in each array, followed by calculation of M-NM-^TM-NM-^TCt for each gene from two arrays: M-NM-^TM-NM-^TCt = M-NM-^TCt1 M-bM-^@M-^S M-NM-^TCt2, where M-NM-^TCt1 is the HDM-sensitized mice group and M-NM-^TCT2 is the unsensitized mice group, using the program provided by Qiagen/SA Biosciences. ID_REF =  VALUE = normalized	Quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify the amounts of mRNA in the lungs using custom RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays manufactured by Qiagen/SA Biosciences. The arrays included 40 assay genes, 5 housekeeping genes, and reverse transcription efficiency and DNA contamination controls. All primer sets were from Qiagen/SA Biosciences, except for the Pglyrp1 primers. cDNA was synthesized from 2 M-5g of RNA using RT2 PCR Array First Strand Kit (Qiagen/SA Biosciences) and the arrays were performed according to the manufacturer instructions using Qiagen/SA Biosciences Master Mix. Each experiment was performed on RNA pooled from 4M-bM-^@M-^S5 mice/group and repeated 3 times with new groups of mice.	n/a	RNA was isolated from right lobes of unsensitized or sensitized lungs using the TRIZOL method (InVitrogen), followed by digestion with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) and purification on RNeasy spin columns using RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen). In each experiment, for qRT-PCR gene expression array RNA was pooled from 4-5 mice per group.	n/a
